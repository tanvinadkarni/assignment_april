## Instructions

To run the code `node index.js`. I have run this code with node v13

## Assumptions 

- Provided input json files are not valid json files as they contain some strings defined with \' instead of \" . 
Inside my code I do a search and replace on \' => \" to get around the problem. This is not ideal. 

- Even though the example input files contain only one feature my code can work with any number of features.
